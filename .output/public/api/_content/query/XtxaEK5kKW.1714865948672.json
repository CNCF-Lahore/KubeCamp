Given the dynamic nature of Pods—being terminated, deleted, or replaced—there needs to be a mechanism for continuous and automatic discovery among Pods and applications. This is where Kubernetes Services come into play, acting as an abstraction layer that groups Pods and allows for their exposure to external traffic, load balancing, and service discovery.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.Kubernetes-Basics:5.Expose-Your-App:1.How-to-make-it-public.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.Kubernetes-Basics/5.Expose-Your-App/1.How-to-make-it-public.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/kubernetes-basics/scale-your-app/scale-in-and-out","_dir":"scale-your-app","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Understanding Scaling","description":"In this module, we delve into scaling your application within a Kubernetes environment. Scaling is a critical aspect of managing applications, ensuring they can handle varying loads of traffic. Kubernetes simplifies this process through Deployments and Services, enabling both scale-out (increasing the number of replicas) and scale-in (decreasing the number of replicas) operations.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.Kubernetes-Basics:6.Scale-Your-App:1.scale-In-and-Out.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.Kubernetes-Basics/6.Scale-Your-App/1.scale-In-and-Out.md","_extension":"md"}]
