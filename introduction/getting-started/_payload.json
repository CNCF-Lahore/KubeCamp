In today's digital landscape, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers are under pressure to deploy new versions of these applications multiple times a day. Kubernetes is designed to support this dynamic environment by enabling:    Continuous Deployment and Scaling : Release and update applications quickly and without downtime.   Efficient Resource Utilization : Intelligent scaling and resource management to meet user demand.   Reliability and Availability : Ensure that applications are always available to users.  Kubernetes combines Google's deep experience in running production loads at scale with the best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
