# Lab 03: Exposing Your Application

In this lab, we will deploy a sample application to a Kubernetes cluster. The application will be automatically exposed using NodePort. NodePort is a simple way to make your application accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster. It is primarily used for testing purposes and is not recommended for production environments.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Navigate to the main directory of the application by entering the root path `/` in your terminal.
   - Deploy the application to the cluster by running the following command:
     ```shell
     make deploy
     ```

2. **Access the Deployed Services:**
   Once the deployment is complete, several services including Zipkin, Swagger, Prometheus, Grafana, and a Node.js application will be running and exposed on various ports. To explore these services, follow the instructions below:

   - **Zipkin:**
     - Zipkin is used for tracing network requests within your application. 
     - To access Zipkin, check the ports section in your terminal and navigate to the port `9411`.
     - To try out Zipkin with sample data, download the following JSON file and upload it to Zipkin:
       ```
       https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-lens/testdata/ascend.json
       ```

   - **Prometheus:**
     - Prometheus is used for monitoring the application. It allows you to see which APIs are currently down.
     - To access Prometheus, navigate to port `30000`.
     - In Prometheus, go to the "Targets" section to view the status of various APIs. For this lab, some APIs are intentionally set to be down and will be brought up later.

   - **Grafana:**
     - Grafana is used for visualizing metrics through graphs.
     - To access Grafana, navigate to port `32000`.
     - Incase if you are not able to login, please dont worry grafana is beyond the scrope for now.
