# Activate Your Sandbox

Before you begin, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- **GitHub Account**: If you do not have a GitHub account, please [create a free account](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"} before starting with the sandbox. This is essential for accessing the Kubernetes Sandbox environment.

- Please ensure that no additional tabs are open to guarantee optimal performance. It is also important to verify that you have a stable internet connection.

- We highly recommend using Google Chrome.
