# What You Will Learn

By the end of this bootcamp, you will have a solid understanding of what Kubernetes is and what it does. Specifically, you will learn how to:

- Deploy, scale, update, and debug containerized applications on a Kubernetes cluster.
- Utilize an interactive online terminal for real-world, practical application of your knowledge.

## Why Kubernetes?

In today's digital landscape, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers are under pressure to deploy new versions of these applications multiple times a day. Kubernetes is designed to support this dynamic environment by enabling:

- **Continuous Deployment and Scaling**: Release and update applications quickly and without downtime.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Intelligent scaling and resource management to meet user demand.
- **Reliability and Availability**: Ensure that applications are always available to users.

Kubernetes combines Google's deep experience in running production loads at scale with the best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

## Workshop Modules

Throughout this bootcamp, you will complete the following modules:

1. [**Create a Cluster**](/introduction-to-cluster/creating-cluster): Learn the basics of Kubernetes clusters and how to set one up.
2. [**Deploy an App**](/deploy-an-app/your-first-app): Deploy your first application on Kubernetes.
3. [**Explore Your App**](/explore-your-app/how-to-explore): Understand how to inspect and interact with your deployed application.
4. [**Expose Your App Publicly**](/expose-your-app/how-to-make-it-public): Make your application accessible from the internet.
5. [**Scale Up Your App**](/scale-your-app/scale-in-and-out): Adjust your application's resources to handle increased traffic.
6. [**Update Your App**](/rolling-up): Safely roll out updates to your application.
