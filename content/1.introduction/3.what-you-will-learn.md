# What You Will Learn

By the end of this bootcamp, you will have a solid understanding of what Kubernetes is and what it does. Specifically, you will learn how to:

- Deploy, scale, update, and debug containerized applications on a Kubernetes cluster.
- Utilize an interactive online terminal for real-world, practical application of your knowledge.

## Why Kubernetes?

In today's digital landscape, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers are under pressure to deploy new versions of these applications multiple times a day. Kubernetes is designed to support this dynamic environment by enabling:

- **Continuous Deployment and Scaling**: Release and update applications quickly and without downtime.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Intelligent scaling and resource management to meet user demand.
- **Reliability and Availability**: Ensure that applications are always available to users.

Kubernetes combines Google's deep experience in running production loads at scale with the best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
