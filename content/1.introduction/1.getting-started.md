# Before We Begin

I'd like to share a story with you—a tale of the Kubernetes Community Days. This marks our second event, unfolding once again in Lahore, made possible by your invaluable support and the contributions of many to this vibrant ecosystem. As a team, we've poured our hearts and souls into this endeavor, driven by a fervent desire to empower our local community with knowledge and resources on Kubernetes. Before the inception of the Kubernetes Community Days, we realized a significant gap: many, including professionals, were unfamiliar with "Kubernetes." Mentioning the name often elicited puzzled looks and curious questions: "Kubernetes? What's that?"

Driven by our realization, we, a group of engineers, ventured into the realm of marketing. Our goal was to illuminate the benefits of Kubernetes, highlight job opportunities, and encourage contributions to the ecosystem. Our marketing efforts were creative and informative; we used memes to demystify Kubernetes and crafted posts and reels that significantly raised awareness. We reached out to potential sponsors, receiving mixed responses, but thankfully, companies like GitHub and Google Cloud stepped forward. Their support enabled us to host a high-quality, free event, complete with meals for all attendees at the Kubernetes Community Days Lahore 2023 edition.

Our efforts bore fruit, attracting over 300 developers to the University of Central Punjab and introducing them to Kubernetes technologies—a monumental achievement for our local community.

Post-event, we identified challenges and strategized solutions for the upcoming year. A notable issue was the accessibility of workshops; the cost of Sandbox labs, especially those based in the US, was prohibitive for many. Alternatives like Minikube or Kubeadm required intricate setups that could take hours. To address this, we've innovated a solution: a new, cost-free Sandbox. This tool enables anyone to set up a Kubernetes lab effortlessly. In the following section, we'll guide you on how to activate and make the most of your Sandbox.
