# Introduction to Kubernetes!

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s (with "8" representing the eight letters that are omitted), is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes is built to run across a cluster of machines, providing a high level of availability.

## Understanding the Kubernetes Cluster

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two main components:

- **Master**: The brain behind the operation, coordinating the cluster.
- **Nodes**: The workers, running your applications.

This diagram illustrates how the master and nodes interact within a Kubernetes cluster.

### Dive Deeper into the Components

#### The Master

The master is responsible for managing the cluster. It makes decisions about where to run applications based on resource availability and other scheduling criteria. It also handles scaling and updates to ensure the cluster operates smoothly.

#### Nodes

A node can be a virtual or physical machine, serving as the workhorse that runs your applications. Each node has the necessary tools to manage container operations, such as Docker, and is managed by the master. Nodes communicate with the master via the Kubernetes API, which the master exposes.

### Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes abstracts the hardware infrastructure, allowing applications to run on any node within the cluster without needing to be tied to specific machines. This flexibility significantly simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling applications.

## Getting Started

For development purposes, **minikube** is a recommended tool. It simplifies the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster by creating a VM on your local machine that hosts a single-node cluster. Minikube supports Linux, macOS, and Windows, offering an accessible way to start with Kubernetes. _Guess what we are using MiniKube with GitHubCodespaces for Kubernetes Sandbox._

### The Name "Kubernetes"

Originating from Greek, Kubernetes means "helmsman" or "pilot," highlighting its role in guiding and managing containerized applications.

## Ready, Set, Go!

Now that you have a basic understanding of Kubernetes and its components, it's time to dive into the practical side.
