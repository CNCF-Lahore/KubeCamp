# lab02: Exploring Pods and Nodes

When working with Kubernetes, managing and exploring Pods and Nodes is crucial. Here's a quick guide on using kubectl commands for these tasks:

**Pods**:
- **Listing Pods Across All Namespaces**: To see every Pod running across all namespaces in your cluster, use:
  ```shell
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```
- **Listing Pods Within a Specific Namespace**: If you want to focus on Pods within a particular namespace, modify your command like so:
  ```shell
  kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
  ```
- **Describing a Pod**: For detailed information about a specific Pod, including its status and events, use the describe command:
  ```shell
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
  ```

**Nodes**:
- **Listing All Nodes**: To get a list of all Nodes in your cluster, along with their status, use:
  ```shell
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
- **Describing a Node**: For a deep dive into a specific Node's details, including the Pods running on it and its available resources, use:
  ```shell
  kubectl describe node <node-name>
  ```
